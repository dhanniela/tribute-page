            <p class="tribute-info">Shoyo Hinata is a first-year student at Karasuno High. He specializes at spiking and later has excellent synchronization with his teammate setter, Tobio Kageyama. Unfortunately, he was born with a small height. However, it doesn't matter to him as he has a strong desire to play for the national team.</p>
            <p class="tribute-info">Upon entering the first-year of high school, Hinata stood at 162.8 cm and grew to 164.2 cm halfway through the school year. He is the second shortest person on the Karasuno volleyball team, next to Nishinoya. He has unruly orange hair and brown eyes. His relatively-thin build and short stature often lead him to be mistaken for a junior high (or, in some cases, even grade school) student. His height and appearance cause him to be misunderstood, but once he started playing, he used to amaze everyone.</p>
            <p class="tribute-info">Hinata was interested in volleyball because of the Karasuno player known as Little Giant. The Little Giant was likewise rather short in height. However, he had excellent gameplay, which encouraged him to play volleyball. He then became a member of the volleyball team at Yukigaoka Junior High. However, he was only one member, so he urged his classmates to join as well. They form a team, and Kitagawa Daiichi Junior High was their first opponent. He competed against Kageyama in this tournament.</p>
